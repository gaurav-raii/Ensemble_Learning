# Ensemble_of_Trees-for-Predicting-oil-production-of-a-refinery.
This Project entails predicting the oil production of a refinery complex using the data containing 12 attributes and cumulative oil production over a course of 4752 days.
In this case Log_cum_production was used as the target(an interval variable).
Bagging and Random Forest methods were used to model the data and comparison to a single decision tree was made which was selected using cross validation
The best decision trees from depths varying from 3 to 15 was selected using a 4 folds cross validation.
